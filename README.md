# Emotion-Based-Movie-TV-Show-Recommender




---

### 6. **Project Presentation:**

For your presentation, you can follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: 
   - Explain the concept of emotion-based recommendations.
   - Real-world applications (e.g., personalized content delivery on streaming platforms).

2. **Problem Statement**: 
   - Traditional recommendation systems are not mood-aware.
   - This system addresses emotional nuances in content recommendation.

3. **Approach**:
   - Emotion detection techniques (face-based vs. text-based).
   - Mapping emotions to specific genres.

4. **Model Design**:
   - Discuss the algorithms used (e.g., CNN for emotion detection, collaborative filtering for recommendations).
   - Mention the datasets used.

5. **System Architecture**:
   - Show a block diagram of the flow (emotion detection → genre mapping → recommendation).

6. **Implementation**:
   - Highlight key code snippets, libraries used, and challenges faced.

7. **Results**:
   - Display sample inputs (text, face) and corresponding recommendations.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the potential impact of such a system and future improvements (e.g., multi-modal input, integrating more emotional categories).

### 7. **Future Improvements**:
- **Multi-modal Emotion Detection**: Combine both text and face for better accuracy.
- **Real-time Feedback Loop**: Let users rate the recommendation to improve future suggestions.
- **Advanced Emotion Models**: Use complex neural networks or pre-trained transformer models for better emotion detection.

This outline should give you a solid structure for implementing and presenting the project.
